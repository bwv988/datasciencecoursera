# Machine Learning

This is a report on predicting human activity by applying machine-learning algorithms, such as _Random Forests_, to a given data set with the aim to build a predictive model.

Before using the data set, however, some data cleaning had to be performed. After building the model and predicting on the data, cross-validation was run to assess model accuracy.

In addition to this, fairly heavy computations in R were sped up via the <p>doMC</p> package ([http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doMC/index.html]) which enables use of multiple cores on modern processors.
